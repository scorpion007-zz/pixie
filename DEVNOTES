Open Issues:
- Purging tessellations for raytracing
- Moving raytraced surface
- Efficient subdivision surface creases
- Subdivision highly creased surface issues
- Bug: Terminating the framebuffer during rendering (FIXED)
- Irradiance accuracy issues

Development notes:

Possible Optimization:

Todos:
- OpenEXR input for textures
- RiDisplayChannel & support
- additional attributes, options visible from SL
- bake, pointcloud and brickmap support (done)
- RiFilter support
- trace subsets
- patch crack stitching
- 64 bit compatibility. 
  The main issue is the shaders keeping all the data in a linear array. This can be fixed by separating the opcodes from arguments.
